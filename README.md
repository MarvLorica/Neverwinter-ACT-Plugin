State
=====
- Needs testing and verification.
- Tracking of CW Chaotic Growth gives the healing credit to the last CW to MM the target.
- Companion pet's may not be handled the best way
- Really wish we could detect zone changes.
- I'm sure there are losts of different special cases left to handle.
- Combat log colored.
- Companion Pet's owners tracked.
